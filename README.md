###Fraud Detection System
Overview
This project aims to build an AI model for detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing false positives. It utilizes machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The system focuses on high recall to detect most fraudulent transactions, with an emphasis on explainability.

Features
Supervised learning models: XGBoost, LightGBM for fraud classification.

Anomaly detection: Isolation Forest for detecting outliers.

Real-time detection: LSTM models for transaction sequence analysis.

Explainability: SHAP and LIME to justify flagged transactions.

APIs: Real-time fraud detection via a REST API.

Data preprocessing: Class balancing with SMOTE and feature engineering.
